move res.debug to system/lib/response
req.data('ipaddr')
fix app.cfg
Date header is in wsh-server only

don't explicitly set global b/c if wrapped in closure, pass in, otherwise we're in node and it's defined

get rid of global.mappaht
  real fs paths should not be used within the app fx at all, which makes mappath adapter-specific

common crypto interface (md5)

decide what to do with async->sync methods accepting/returning buffer
  normalize to binary string (at Fiber.sync level?)
  ditch buffer abstraction

possibly:
  rename uploaded file based on original filename
  fiber-safe fs write/append
