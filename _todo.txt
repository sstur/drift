tests:
  url.parse
  url.resolve
  url.normalize

implement:
  util.joinPath

refactor:
  sync/async modules to wrappers/
  use send module instead of connect
  remove http patches

consolidate:
  Object.extend and util.extend
  parseCookies, parseHeaders, parseUrl (http client)
  client request headers
  server response headers
  qs lib
  json reviver/replacer

req.data('ipaddr')
fix app.cfg
Date header in node-server

iis:
  fs.writeFile
  error.asp with line-number translation

apache:
  persist app data

get rid of global.mappath
  real fs paths should not be used within app/ at all, which makes mappath adapter-specific

remove app.data and fix it in adapters:
  node uses memory (from core.js)
  iis needs written
  apache needs localdb

common crypto interface (md5)

decide what to do with async->sync methods accepting/returning buffer
  normalize to binary string (at Fiber.sync level?)
  ditch buffer abstraction

possibly:
  rename uploaded file based on original filename
  fiber-safe fs write/append
