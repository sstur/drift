fixes:
  route verb
  wsh error

tests for url.parse, url.resolve and url.normalize

move res.debug to system/lib/response
req.data('ipaddr')
fix app.cfg
Date header is in wsh-server only

iis:
  fs.writeFile
  http module
  error.asp with line-number translation

apache:
  mac
  persist app data

get rid of global.mappath
  real fs paths should not be used within the app fx at all, which makes mappath adapter-specific

remove app.data and fix it in adapters:
  node uses memory (from core.js)
  iis needs written
  apache needs localdb

common crypto interface (md5)
consolidate Object.extend and util.extend
consolidate:
  parseCookies, parseHeaders, parseUrl (http client)
  client request headers
  server response headers
  qs lib
  json reviver/replacer

decide what to do with async->sync methods accepting/returning buffer
  normalize to binary string (at Fiber.sync level?)
  ditch buffer abstraction

possibly:
  rename uploaded file based on original filename
  fiber-safe fs write/append
