#Cross-platform JS App Framework

This is a small framework for writing basic apps in server-side JavaScript and then deploying to any of
several server-side platforms. There is a devserver written in Node and a basic build script (also in
Node) that will produce a set of files that can be deployed to the various platforms.

Partially supported platforms:
 * Node (using Fibers)
 * Apache (using v8cgi)
 * IIS (native)

##Status: Incomplte
This is a proof-of-concept project and it is by no means complete.
