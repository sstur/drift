request: body parsing tests need to allow req.body() to throw null (HTTP 4XX)

Test:
  Models revive boolean fields from DB (which stores as int)
  Globals, Buffer
  url.parse
  url.resolve
  url.normalize

Front-End Tests
  Properly report 500 Err
  Conform XHR so tests.js can be used from node and browser

Filesystem:
  copy/moveFile: if dst is directory append src name
  moveDir: src does not exist; src is file; dest is empty dir; dest is non-empty dir; dest is file
