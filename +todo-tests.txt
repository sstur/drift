  body parsing
    tests need to allow req.body() to throw null (HTTP 4XX)
    don't throw null, throw Constants.HTTP_403
    allow body-parser to throw fs error if cannot save to file (dir not exists/writable)
    allow file.saveTo before end is emitted
    test all props available in file (binary and multipart); test file.saveTo



Test:
  Models revive boolean fields from DB (which stores as int)
  Globals, Buffer
  url.parse
  url.resolve
  url.normalize

Front-End Tests
